# stargazing-tracker-app

## INTRODUCTION

This React-Redux SPA with a Rails backend is for people who love to look into the sky! As anyone who has looked into a telescope knows, it can be tough to know where to look or to know what you're looking at. Stargazing Tracker provides a list of Messier Objects that users can use to identify where exactly in the sky some of the most famous celestial bodies are, and learn more about them. The user can then add the object to their Observations list to keep track of what they've seen in the sky. Users can also use the search bar to find fellow stargazers, add them to their friends list, and view the Messier Objects that they've observed.

## INSTALLATION

## USAGE
